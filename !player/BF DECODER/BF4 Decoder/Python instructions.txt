1) Download Python here: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6.msi
2) Right click on the bf4dumper.py file, choose "Edit with IDLE".
3) Adjust the script if necessary. Save with Ctrl+S.
4) Run the script by pressing F5. A shell will open showing the names of extracted files. Note that the asterisks in the title of the shell indicate that the script is running.
5) The script is finished when the asterisks are gone and a new line (>>>) awaiting further input appears.

What about the other two py scripts?
	They are imported by the dumper script. It's not necessary to modify them and they don't do really anything when you run them.

Where to place dlls/auxiliary py scripts?
	Either next to the bf4dumper.py or in the Python folder, i.e. C:\Python27.
	I tend to put the dlls in the Python folder and leave the scripts next to each other.
